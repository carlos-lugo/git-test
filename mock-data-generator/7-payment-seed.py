# --- Partition Structures and Relationships ---
# This script generates mock data for the PAYMENT partition.

# Basic Partitions (Independent):
# - STUDENT: Represents individual student data.
# - EXAM_PLACE: Represents available exam locations.
# - BANK_ACCOUNT: Represents bank accounts for payments.
#
# Dependent Partitions:
# - EXAM: Depends on BANK_ACCOUNT (for exam fees).
# - EXAM_HOLD: Depends on EXAM and EXAM_PLACE.
# - APPLICATION: Depends on STUDENT, EXAM_HOLD.
# - PAYMENT: Depends on APPLICATION.
# - CERTIFICATION: Depends on APPLICATION.
